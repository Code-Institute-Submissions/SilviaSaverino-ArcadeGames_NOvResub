# Classic Games

##  Strategy/Scope
Classic Games is an entertainment site intended for users that are looking to play and de-stress. The site features three games the user can play with:
- 1)Goat & Monkey
- 2)Rock Paper Scissor 
- 3)Falling star

The site goal is to enjoy playing and have some fun whilst trying any of the games. No scores or level have been added yet.
In each page the user will find a similar layout with playgrounds centred, some instructions showing up and intuitive site interface to navigate the site itself.
Entertaining arcade sound effects and mostly arcade graphic backgrounds on game1 and game3 had been selected to let the user re-experience somehow some nostalgic feelings. 
The style of game2 differ a bit to catch the attention of a more younger audience, whilst displaying one of the oldest game ever. 



## Site owner goals

As owner I would like to:

  •	provide entertaining and interactive experience to all users.

  •	provide a link to social platform to recruit more gamers.

  •	to provide a responsive website, ideal for any device out there.


##  User goals

As user I would like to:

•	Navigate easily through the website.

•   Have hints on how to play the game.

•	See clean interface and be able to track progress/score. (coming soon!)

•	Play/pause audio if not interested.

•	Enjoy the game with no challenges and difficult levels.

•	Be able to re-play the game without using "back" button in the browser.

•	Follow developer’s social platforms and users posts too. 


#   User Experience (UX)

##  Colour Scheme
The colour scheme is maintained throughout the website. The body background features a few colors, ranging from yellow,purple,pink,and light-blue and so on. These same palette had been used throughout the whole site.

The main difference the user will notice is about the backgrounds chosen for each game.

- In the first game-Goat&Monkey, a background of mountains had been chosen to set the Goat and the Monkey in a possible real scenario.

- In the second game-Rock_Paper_Scissor, a background featuring some player/computer moves had been selected to let the user jump into a rock-paper-scissors world. 
The colour scheme with relaxing shade of blue, pink and yellow, is constant throughout the game.

- In the third game-Falling_Star, a background of a sky at night had been chosen to set the star character in a ‘’real’’ scenario too. 
The user will experience a shade of purple and blue with some dots of white and yellow, recreating the starts and satellites and planets of this arcade universe.

##  Typography

The font that had been used in the website is:
- Chakra Petch
with a fall back of Sans serif and Helvetica.

The above primary font had been selected from the vast catalog offered by [Google font](https://fonts.google.com/); I've found its resemblance to arcade games fonts used back in the 80s and 90s to be a good fit for this website.

##  Structure
### Homepage:

The site homepage besides the logo and the footer, features a small selection of games the user can choose from.

Displayed centrally on the screen and with a color palette of pinks, purples and yellows to increase visibility contrast with the background.

###1st Game - Goat & Monkey:

By clicking on the first game option the user will have the possibility to play an interpretation of the classic game developed by Google [Dinosaur Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur_Game).

- The user will be able to control the character:
a simple goat

by left-clicking on the mouse, to let it jump and avoid the obstacle, in this scenario: a monkey on an electric-scooter.

- The game won't start until the user will click on the start button that appears centrally on the playground as soon as the game is opened.

- In the possible instance that the player won't be quick enought to avoid the monkey, a collision will happen and the game will be over. Yet, the user will be able to choose to play again by clicking on the button that appears after collision.

- Should the user decide that she/he would like to play a different game, a simple nav bar had been provided in the header, to let the user easily navigate the website. Links will change depending on which game the user will be playing.
