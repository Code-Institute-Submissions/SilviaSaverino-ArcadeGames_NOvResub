# Classic Games

##  Strategy/Scope
Classic Games is an entertainment site intended for users that are looking to play and de-stress. The site features three games the user can play with:
- 1)Goat & Monkey
- 2)Rock Paper Scissor 
- 3)Falling star

The site goal is to enjoy playing and have some fun whilst trying any of the games. No scores or level have been added yet.
In each page the user will find a similar layout with playgrounds centred, some instructions showing up and intuitive site interface to navigate the site itself.
Entertaining arcade sound effects and mostly arcade graphic backgrounds on game1 and game3 had been selected to let the user re-experience somehow some nostalgic feelings. 
The style of game2 differ a bit to catch the attention of a more younger audience, whilst displaying one of the oldest game ever. 



## Site owner goals

  •	provide a link to social platform to recruit more gamers.

  •	to provide a responsive website, ideal for any device out there.


##  User goals

•	Navigate easily through the website.

•   Have hints on how to play the game.

•	See clean interface and be able to track progress/score. (coming soon!)

•	Play/pause audio if not interested.

•	Enjoy the game with no challenges and difficult levels.

•	Be able to re-play the game without using "back" button in the browser.

•	Follow developer’s social platforms and users posts too. 


#   User Experience (UX)

##  Colour Scheme
The colour scheme is maintained throughout the website. The main difference the user will notice is about the background chosen on each game.
1)	Add picture
In the first game, a background of mountains had been chosen to set the Goat and the Monkey in a possible real scenario.

2)	Add picture
In the second game, a background featuring some player/computer moves had been selected to let the user jump into a rock-paper-scissors world. The colour scheme with relaxing shade of blue, pink and yellow, is constant throughout the game.
3)	Add Picture
In the third game, a background of a sky at night had been chosen to set the star character in a ‘’real’’ scenario too. The user will experience a shade of purple and blue with some dots of white and yellow, recreating the starts and satellites and planets in that arcade universe.
